# Build a Blazor todo list app
Add the todo list app to your existing project instead of creating a new one. 

If you really want to create a new project, when following the tutorial, for "Choose a Blazor hosting model" pick Blazor WebAssembly.

Review the instructions to Run a project in Visual Studio and Modify a project in Visual Studio above. 

You can create the new page through Visual Studio by copying, pasting, and renaming an existing file or you can create the new page through the command prompt like in the tutorial instructions after going to your existing project folder using cd. 

Use the Build a Blazor todo list app tutorial to

modify NavMenu.razor

create Todo.razor

create TodoItem.cs

Once you have it working locally, commit and push to GitHub.

Update your Readme to look more professional and be more accurate and useful. Include a link to your deployed app and a link to the todo list tutorial. 

Since your remote repository on GitHub now has been changed more recently than your local repository, do a Pull from the Git Changes tab in Visual Studio.
